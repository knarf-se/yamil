yamil — a fenomenal YAML parser
===============================

yamil Is a parser that is meant to parse a great subset of the YAML serialization format, mostly the bits and pieces that I need for my own projects; I could probaly have used JSON with an Ad hoc structure ontop.
But, *meh*. YAML is more suited for human consumption, which I likes.

The yamil project is released under the very liberal MIT License, and this mostly means that you can use it any way you like, see → [`LICENSE.md`][lic] for more details. I encourage you to hack away and contribute your changes back to the project.

The current **status** of this project is young and immature, please expect a bumpy ride and a few nucelar glitches here and there ;-)
